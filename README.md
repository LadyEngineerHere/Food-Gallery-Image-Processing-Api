Project: 
Food Gallery Image Processsing API

Introduction: 
This Api allows you to resize any photo displayed in the Food Gallery by taking its file name and entering the desired height and width. Change the URL to match your desired results.

Example: 
http://localhost:3005/api/images?filename=burger&height=30&width=30

PS: I used port 3005 because the standard 3000 was in use. Use need to add in the node_modules folder. It was to large to upload.


Result:
You can find your resized images in the 'resized' folder.
/Food Gallery Image Processing API/public/images/resized
